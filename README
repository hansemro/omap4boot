USB downloader and USB second stage bootloader for OMAP44xx
===========================================================

Pandaboard ES Notes
-------------------

With SD card and 5V power supply removed, plug in mini-USB cable to USB-OTG port
(@J18) to enter omap usb boot mode. Your computer should recognize the device as
`0451:d010 Texas Instruments, Inc. OMAP4440`. This device may disconnect and
reconnect every few seconds (this is normal behavior). While in this mode, use
the usbboot utility to load 2ndstage and 3rdstage images.

If your computer has trouble recognizing the device as OMAP4440, try another
mini-USB cable.

If encountering errors with usbboot, try a different USB port on the same
machine or on another machine. usbboot is not very reliable and may require
multiple attempts.

aboot.bin
---------

aboot.bin is a designed to be a second stage USB bootloader (what TI
calls x-loader) for the USB peripheral boot mode of OMAP44xx.

Currently it's somewhat pandaboard-centric, but that should be
easy enough to clean up -- it shouldn't touch any gpiomux config
except (maybe) for the UART.

All it does is send a u32 message (0xaabbccdd) back over the USB link, 
then reads a u32 size from the host.  Then it downloads size bytes
from the host to 0x82000000 and jumps to that address.


usbboot
-------

usage: usbboot <2ndstage> [ <image> ]

- usbboot will poll every 250ms until it locates an OMAP device 
  (VID 0451, PID d00f)
- it then will send the 2ndstage binary to the device 
- if an image was also provided, it will wait for the 2ndstage to
  send the go-ahead response (0xaabbccdd) and then send that image
